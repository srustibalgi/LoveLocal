#EASY 1
#Solution discription
#The first while loop moves the pointer i backwards through the string until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then we're ready to start counting the length of the word we just hit, so the second loop increments length and moves i backwards until a whitespace character is found.
#Once that whitespace character is found, that means we've finished traversing the word, so the only thing left to do is to return length.

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        length = 0
        i = len(s) - 1
        while i >= 0 and s[i] == ' ':
            i -= 1
        while i >= 0 and s[i] != ' ':
            length += 1
            i -= 1
        return length
